# Welcome

If you have just cloned this repo, please be sure to follow the `Initial setup` instructions below.

## Example 1 - Use a locally-hosted LLM

If you have this project correctly configured - and `ollama` serving the custom model we specified in the `Modelfile` - you can run this project with the following commands:

```sh
# Activate our virtual environment with the installed dependencies
% poetry shell

# Run our crew(s)
% time python main.py

```

After making sure that the proper local model was configured - and that `max_rpm` was not restricting rate limiting - here is the final result including how long the first run took on my machine:

- 2021 14" MacBook Pro
  - Apple M1 Max
  - 64 GB memory
  - 2 TB SSD
  - macOS Sonoma `14.5`
    - Node.js `v20.11.1`
    - npm `10.8.1`
    - Python `3.11.1`

```sh

Your midjourney description:
Based on our conversation, here are three reviewed options of photographs that align with the product's goals:

**Option 1:** "Hands-free Moment"
Description: Capture a high-tech airplain in a beautiful blue sky during a breathtaking sunset. The airplan should be in a beautiful and sleek design, with a smart LED display highlighting the temperature control feature.
In this scenario, we'll create a stunning visual that showcases the convenience of using a temperature control coffee mug while doing multiple tasks at once.

**Option 2:** "The Daily Grind"
Description: Depict an individual enjoying their morning routine with a warm, perfectly-tempered beverage from our temperature control coffee mug. The photo should be in 4K resolution, with a soft and natural lighting.
In this scene, we'll capture the moment where someone is sipping from our product while feeling refreshed and ready for the day ahead.

**Option 3:** "Caffeine-Fueled Productivity"
Description: Show an individual in their workspace, intensely focused on their laptop or papers as steam rises from a cup of perfectly-tempered beverage. This photo should be crisp and sharp, with a sense of energy and productivity.
In this scenario, we'll create a vivid visual that highlights how our temperature control coffee mug can fuel your day, allowing you to stay focused and energized.

I hope these options meet the customer's expectations!

## Initial setup - macOS

### Install Poetry

You can make sure Poetry is installed by running the following:

```sh
# Install Poetry
% curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# Verify Poetry is installed
% poetry --version
Poetry (version 1.8.3)
```

### Create our own local model for experimentation

Let's use the model definition at `./Modelfile` and create a new local model to use:

```sh
# List available models on our machine
% ollama list
NAME            ID              SIZE    MODIFIED       
llama3:8b       365c0bd3c000    4.7 GB  16 minutes ago

# Create a custom model based on our definition
% ollama create crewai-llama3-8b -f ./Modelfile

# List available models on our machine and verify our new model is created ðŸ¤“
% ollama list
NAME                    ID              SIZE    MODIFIED       
crewai-llama3-8b:latest e24ebf105f8e    4.7 GB  13 seconds ago
llama3:8b               365c0bd3c000    4.7 GB  17 minutes ago

```

### Setup our development environment

```sh
# Install dependencies from pyproject.toml
% poetry install --no-root

```

### Activate our virtual environment with the installed dependencies

```sh
% poetry shell
Spawning shell within /Users/rob/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/marketing-crew-LQXOd6n7-py3.11
rob@prism instagram-llama3-crewai % emulate bash -c '. /Users/rob/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/marketing-crew-LQXOd6n7-py3.11/bin/activate'
(marketing-crew-py3.11) rob@prism instagram-llama3-crewai % 

```

TIP: Copy and paste the full shell path - `/Users/rob/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/marketing-crew-LQXOd6n7-py3.11` in the above example - to be used as the path to your interpreter in VS Code.
